A plugin to push events to the Ringier Event Bus when articles are created, updated or deleted.

## AUDIENCE ##

This plugin is made for Ringier businesses using WordPress and wanting to benefit from Hexagon solutions available via the Ringier Event Bus. It can be implemented by developers and non-developers.

## BENEFITS ##

The Hexagon solutions available via the Ringier Event Bus and compatible with this plugin include:
- The syncing of articles with Sailthru media library,
- The storage of article events in Ringier Datalake, from which they are retrieved by the Content Distribution Engine (CDE).
You can also benefit from the Bus tooling such as event logging, event monitoring and alerting.

## HOW IT WORKS ##

The plugin automatically triggers events when articles are created, updated and deleted.
Event names: ArticleCreated, ArticleUpdated and ArticleDeleted.

The **events are scheduled** to be sent to the Bus **within a 1-minute delay**. This is to allow WordPress to process the changes and update custom fields in the database, which is done asynchronously. You can view scheduled events by making use of the plugin "Advanced Cron Manager".

Here is a summary of the events sent to the Bus:
- If the article is newly created, we send it INSTANTLY - sent as **ArticleCreated**
    - But then we schedule it to run again after the normal 1 minute so that all custom data are sent properly - sent as **ArticleUpdated**
- For all existing articles that undergo an update, we schedule the event to run after the 1 minute interval

The plugin also creates two mandatory custom fields, available on the article editor page under "Event Bus" widget:
- The article lifetime (lifetime)
- The publication reason (publication_reason)

We also expose custom filters to help you adjust these two fields and the payload sent to the BUS endpoint, see below.

### LOGS ###

This plugin creates a log file (**ringier_bus_plugin_error_log**), saved inside the wp-content/ folder:
The error messages are viewable via the admin UI by clicking on the submenu "LOG".
You also have the flexibility to clear the log file via the UI itself.

## CUSTOM FILTERS ##

The plugin exposes three custom filters to help you adjust the plugin's JSON Payload that is sent to the BUS endpoint.

### 1. Modifying the Publication Reason ###

You can customize the publication reason for an article by using the **ringier_bus_get_publication_reason** filter. This filter allows you to modify the publication reason before it is sent to the Ringier Event Bus.

Example:
```
function custom_publication_reason(string $publication_reason, int $post_ID): string
{
    // Your custom logic goes here
    return 'Custom Publication Reason';
}
add_filter('ringier_bus_get_publication_reason', 'custom_publication_reason', 10, 2);
```

### 2. Modifying the Article Lifetime Payload ###

You can customize the article lifetime for an article by using the **ringier_bus_get_article_lifetime** filter. This filter allows you to modify the article lifetime before it is sent to the Ringier Event Bus.

Example:
```
function custom_article_lifetime(string $article_lifetime, int $post_ID): string
{
    // Your custom logic goes here
    return 'Custom Article Lifetime';
}
add_filter('ringier_bus_get_article_lifetime', 'custom_article_lifetime', 10, 2);
```

### 3. Modifying the Article Payload Data ###

You can customize the payload data for an article by using the **ringier_bus_build_article_payload** filter. This filter allows you to modify the payload data before it is sent to the Ringier Event Bus.

Example:
```
function custom_build_article_payload(array $payload_array, int $post_ID, WP_Post $post): array
{
    // Add a custom field to the payload for example
    $payload_array['custom_field'] = 'Custom Value';
    return $payload_array;
}
add_filter('ringier_bus_build_article_payload', 'custom_build_article_payload', 10, 3);
```

== Changelog ==

### 3.0.0 (Jul 12, 2024) ###
* [BREAKING] PHP Version | The code base now requires a minimum version of PHP 8.1+
* [NEW] Added three new custom filters to allow for more flexibility in the plugin's behavior (see readme file):
    - `ringier_bus_get_publication_reason` - allows you to filter the publication reason before it is sent to the BUS API
    - `ringier_bus_get_article_lifetimez` - allows you to filter the article lifetime before it is sent to the BUS API
    - `ringier_build_article_payload` - allows you to filter the entire article payload before it is sent to the BUS API
* [UPDATE]: Changed the way events are sent:
    - on new article creation, an event will now be immediately sent (this is a requirement for internal CIET)
    - the event will still be queued to run or re-run (in the case of an article update) after the default 1 minute
* [UPDATE]: Harmonised page title and menu
* [UPDATE]: Updated composer dependencies
* [UPDATE]: Cache nonce now defaults to the plugin version number for consistency
* [UPDATE]: Add more intuitive prompts to guide user, for e.g provide the STAGING and PROD endpoints right there in the UI to be handy for them

### 2.3.0 (Oct 9, 2023) ###
* [UPDATE]: Transitioned from relying on the rest_after_insert_post hook to the more universally available transition_post_status hook.

*Reason*:
We identified that some blogs were disabling the Gutenberg editor and as a result, not utilizing the new WordPress REST API. This meant that the rest_after_insert_post hook wasn't being triggered for those instances. To ensure consistent and robust post update handling across all blogs, regardless of their editor choice, we've shifted to the transition_post_status hook.
